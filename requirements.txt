# Core dependencies for animal detection pipeline
ultralytics      # YOLO training and inference
opencv-python    # Video processing

# Note: ultralytics will install numpy, torch, and other dependencies automatically
# ByteTrack tracking is built into ultralytics - no extra install needed

# For GPU training, ultralytics installs CUDA-compatible PyTorch automatically
# For manual GPU setup, see: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
