# Holdout A Dataset Configuration
# Location_05 images - different camera/environment from main training data
# Used for evaluating model generalization - NEVER train on this data

path: data/holdout_a
train: images  # Not used - holdout only
val: images    # Not used - holdout only  
test: images   # Evaluation split

# Class names - must match training config
names:
  0: bear
  1: canine
  2: cervidae

# Holdout metadata
# Source: location_05 from validation set
# Images: 20
# Purpose: Test generalization to different camera placement
