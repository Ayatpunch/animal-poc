# Dataset configuration for YOLO training
# This file tells YOLO where your images/labels are and what classes to detect

# Paths (relative to where you run training, or use absolute paths)
path: ../data  # Root folder containing train/val/test
train: train/images
val: val/images
test: test/images

# Class names - MUST match exactly what's in Roboflow export
# Order matters! These match Roboflow's class IDs
names:
  0: canine      # wolves, coyotes, dogs, foxes
  1: cervidae    # deer, elk, moose
  2: negative    # bears, non-targets (included in data, ignored in inference)

# Notes:
# - Model will detect all 3 classes during training
# - infer_gated.py ignores "negative" class for alerts
# - 680 total images from Roboflow export
