# Holdout B Dataset Configuration
# Mixed location_01 + location_06 subset - different environment/time
# Used for evaluating model generalization - NEVER train on this data

path: data/holdout_b
train: images  # Not used - holdout only
val: images    # Not used - holdout only
test: images   # Evaluation split

# Class names - must match training config
names:
  0: bear
  1: canine
  2: cervidae

# Holdout metadata
# Source: location_01 (3) + location_06 subset (25) from validation set
# Images: 28
# Purpose: Test generalization to mixed environments
